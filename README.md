### CodeHS is only meant for small programs... Or is it?

This program is meant to push just how far you can go with CodeHS - a programming website that my school uses.

### How to run
Clone the repo using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/BJL156/School-Graphics-Engine/
```
Then it's as simple as compling all of the files and running the program.

### Why would I do this
I get bored in school, and in order to test my graphics programming knowledge, it's good to try and make a software renderer with no help from external libraries or APIs like OpenGL or Vulkan.
